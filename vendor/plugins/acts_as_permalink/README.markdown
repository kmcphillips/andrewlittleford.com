## Usage

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_permalink
    end

That's about it. 
The plugin expects string fields to be used to save the permalink on the model and to use as a source for the permalink. It defaults to use the fields named "title" and "permalink" which can be overridden by options:

    :from        =>  :title       # Name of the active record column or function used to generate the permalink
    :to          =>  :permalink   # Name of the column where the permalink will be stored
    :max_length  =>  60           # Maximum number of characters the permalink will be

So, for example you have want to store your permalink in a column called "path_name" and you want to generate your permalink using first and last name, and you want to restrict it to 40 characters, your model would look like:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_permalink :from => :full_name, :to => :path, :max_length => 40

      def full_name
        first_name + last_name
      end
    end
